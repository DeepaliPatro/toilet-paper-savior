                        This game is my take on the classic single-player puzzle game, Minesweeper. Here are the basic rules:
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography gutterBottom>
                        The game board contains hidden viruses under some of the tiles. The size of the board and number of viruses varies depending on the difficulty level.
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography gutterBottom>
                        Your goal is to uncover all the tiles on the board that are clear of viruses, without exposing any of the contaminated tiles.
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography gutterBottom>
                        To help you accomplish this goal, each tile that does not contain a virus will display a number that indicates the number of viruses under the adjacent tiles (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography gutterBottom>
                        If you click on a tile that contains a virus, the game is over and you lose.
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography gutterBottom>
                        You can mark tiles that you think might contain a virus by right-clicking on them. This will place a ðŸ§» on the tile to help stop the spread. ðŸ§»s are useful for keeping track of which tiles you think are dangerous.
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography gutterBottom>
                        If you uncover all the tiles that do not contain viruses, you win!
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography gutterBottom>
                        That's about it! Good luck!
                    </Typography>
